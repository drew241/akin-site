            <p class="muted">
              The Passive House standard is a highly energy efficient building standard that reduces a building's ecological footprint while
              achieving a comfortable temperature year-round with minimal energy use, making conventional heating and air conditioning
              systems obsolete.

            <h3>Prefab modular</h3>
            <p class="muted">
              The building is constructed off-site, under controlled conditions, using the same materials and design as conventional on-site
              building — but in a fraction of the time. Buildings are produced in panels that, when assembled on site, reflect the identical
              design intent and specifications of Passive House standards.
